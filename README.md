# DonkeySwap

An intentionally vulnerable, [Coin](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/doc/coin.md#0x1_coin)-swapping protocol for Aptos.

It's basically an AMM that uses an oracle for pricing, and LP coins minted represent the USD value of liquidity deposits/withdrawals. Featuring support for limit swap orders!

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate common vulnerabilities we see in Aptos Move protocols.
